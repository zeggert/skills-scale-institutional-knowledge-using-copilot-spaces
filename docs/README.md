# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README provides an overview of OctoAcme's standardized project management processes and links to all institutional knowledge documents in this repository.

## Project Management Process Summary
OctoAcme uses a structured, iterative approach for project delivery from initiation through release and continuous improvement. Key tenets include:
- Customer-first value delivery
- Iterative planning, clear roles and responsibilities
- Data-driven decisions with transparent communication
- Risk management and stakeholder alignment
- Continuous improvement post-release

Our project management lifecycle:
1. **Initiation:** Define problem, stakeholders, goals
2. **Planning:** Scope, estimates, backlog, risk
3. **Execution & Tracking:** Daily delivery, progress review, blocker escalation
4. **Risk & Communication:** Ongoing tracking and reporting, escalation paths
5. **Release & Deployment:** Standardized steps for lower risk and visibility
6. **Retrospective & Improvement:** Capture learnings, close gaps
